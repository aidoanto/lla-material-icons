This is a UV project where I am trying to create a library of images that use the Google Material Icons library.

An explanation of how to use these icons is in material-icons.md

There may be other ways to use them, I'm not sure. 

A. Here, you are to create 3 subfolders inside /icons, icons blue-alpha, blue-beige, and orange-beige:

1. blue-alpha
icon: 221FBB
bg: transparent/alpha

2. blue-beige
icon: 221FBB
bg: F3EBD9

3. orange-blue
icon: 221FBB
bg: FF9E85

4. blue-yellow
icon: 221FBB
bg: FFD075

B. Inside each folder, there will be a 500x500 .png, for each of the material icons. In that png, there will be a circle, which will be 500px radius, centered. Layered on top will be the icon, centered in the square, in the icon color, at a width of 350px. with the icon color as the icon's color and bg as the bg color. The icons will have the name of the material icon + the color variation i.e. "blue-alpha".
