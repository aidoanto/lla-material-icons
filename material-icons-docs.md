## What are Material Symbols?

Material Symbols are our newest icons, consolidating over 2,500 glyphs in a single font file with a wide range of design variants. Symbols are available in three styles and four adjustable variable font axes (fill, weight, grade, and optical size). See the full set of Material Symbols in the [Material Symbols Library](http://fonts.google.com/icons).

### `FILL` axis

Fill gives you the ability to modify the default icon style. A single icon can render both unfilled and filled states.

To convey a state transition, use the fill axis for animation or interaction. The values are 0 for default or 1 for completely filled. Along with the weight axis, the fill also impacts the look of the icon.

### `wght` axis

Weight defines the symbol’s stroke weight, with a range of weights between thin (100) and bold (700). Weight can also affect the overall size of the symbol.

### `GRAD` axis

![Grade axis
visualization](https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/apps/fonts/1x/material-symbols/grade.png)

Weight and grade affect a symbol’s thickness. Adjustments to grade are more granular than adjustments to weight and have a small impact on the size of the symbol.

Grade is also available in some text fonts. You can match grade levels between text and symbols for a harmonious visual effect. For example, if the text font has a -25 grade value, the symbols can match it with a suitable value, say -25.

You can use grade for different needs:

**Low emphasis (e.g. -25 grade):** To reduce glare for a light symbol on a dark background, use a low grade.

**High emphasis (e.g. 200 grade):** To highlight a symbol, increase the positive grade.

### `opsz` axis

Optical sizes range from 20dp to 48dp.

For the image to look the same at different sizes, the stroke weight (thickness) changes as the icon size scales. Optical size offers a way to automatically adjust the stroke weight when you increase or decrease the symbol size.

## Getting Material Symbols

Material Symbols are available in several formats and are suitable for different types of projects and platforms, both for developers in their apps and for designers in their mockups or prototypes.

$ git clone https://github.com/google/material-design-icons

## Using Material Symbols

Use in Web

The Material Symbols font is the easiest way to incorporate Material Symbols into web projects.

The icons are packaged into a single font so that web developers can easily incorporate these icons with only a few lines of code.

#### Static font with Google Fonts

The easiest way to set up icon fonts for use in any web page is through [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/). Include this single line of HTML:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined" rel="stylesheet" />

The above snippet includes the default configuration for each [axis](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/axis_in_variable_fonts) , with [weight](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/weight_axis) at 400, [optical size](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_size_axis) at 48, [grade](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/grade_axis) at 0 and [fill](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/fill_axis) (also 0.)

Use the [Fonts CSS API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/css2#forming_api_urls) to configure different axes values. Take a look at the following examples:

See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tomasdev/pen/VwyMzjo/69248e71cb99462e8a6c54cdca20fbab"> Material Symbols: weight 100</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>. See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tomasdev/pen/vYpeJyY/04e889d396a80a7261b06a949968c16b"> Material Symbols: static axes (advanced)</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

#### Variable font with Google Fonts

If you're animating icons via CSS, or want finer control over icon features, use the Google Symbols variable font. Using ranges, in the format `number..number`, we can load the entire variable font. Check out [Can I Use's Variable Fonts support](https://caniuse.com/variable-fonts) to understand if your users will be capable of loading the variable font, most likely they are. Here are some examples:

See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tomasdev/pen/VwyMzbZ/daacd5f6bfaecba5aa4209afc1a8a4e3"> Material Symbols: variable axes</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

Or even animate them!

See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tomasdev/pen/LYezjLK/6b8ad22c9640ff946faa06d8d662215e"> Material Symbols: variable axes animated</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

#### Optimize the icon font

-   Subset the font to only include the relevant icons for your application using the `&icon_names` query parameter, using an alphabetically sorted comma-separated list of icon names (ligatures.)
    
    Not recommended — Using the default settings loads all 3,800+ icons. Font payload: **295 KB**
    
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined

Recommended — Specifying icon names to loads only the necessary icons. Font payload: **1.7 KB**

-   https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined&icon_names=home,palette,settings&display=block
    
-   Instance the variable font axes to only include the ones your application will use. Most applications only need a few variations of the axes.
    
    Not recommended — Missing the axes configuration loads the default static font (weight 400, optical size 24, round 50, grade 0, fill 0). Including all variable font axes in full is usually unnecessary and increases the payload. Font payload: **7.9 MB**
    
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined
    https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD,ROND@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200,0..100

Recommended — A specific combination of axes is used. Just as an example, the full 'FILL' axis provides CSS transitions between states, and 'ROND' 100 is the chosen design. Font payload: **2.6 KB**

1.  https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:FILL,ROND@0..1,100&icon_names=home,palette,settings&display=block
    

**Important:** Ensure the CSS request includes `&display=block` to prevent a flash of unstyled text content (FOUC) showing the ligatures until the font loads.

#### Self-hosting the font

Host the [icon font](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/variablefont) in a location you control, in order to decide when to update the asset. For example if the URL is `https://example.com/material-symbols.woff`, then add the following CSS rule:

@font-face {
      font-family: 'Material Symbols Outlined';
      font-style: normal;
      src: url(https://example.com/material-symbols.woff) format('woff');
    }

**Note:** To provide the best experience for all users, multiple font formats may be required, which the Google Fonts API provides. Learn more about “self hosting” on [Google Fonts Knowledge](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/self_hosting_web_fonts).

To render the font properly, declare the CSS rules for rendering the icon. These rules are normally served as part of the Google Fonts API stylesheet, but will need to be included manually in your projects when self-hosting:

.material-symbols-outlined {
      font-family: 'Material Symbols Outlined';
      font-weight: normal;
      font-style: normal;
      font-size: 24px;  /* Preferred icon size */
      display: inline-block;
      line-height: 1;
      text-transform: none;
      letter-spacing: normal;
      word-wrap: normal;
      white-space: nowrap;
      direction: ltr;
    }

#### Using the icons in HTML

The examples provided above use a typographic feature called [ligatures](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/ligature) , which allows rendering of an icon glyph by using its textual name. The web browser automatically replaces the text ligature with the icon vector and provides more readable code than the equivalent numeric character reference. For example, in your HTML you will have `arrow_forward` to represent an icon, instead of `&#xE5C8;`. For other icons, use the _snake case_ of the icon name (i.e. replace spaces with underscores).

This feature is supported in most modern browsers on both desktop and mobile devices. See [Can I Use's ligatures support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_font-variant-ligatures) to see if your users will be capable of processing ligatures, most likely they can.

If you do need to support browsers that do not support ligatures, specify the icons using numeric character references (a.k.a. codepoints) like the example below:

See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/tomasdev/pen/qBpPXxz/111d73542726cfecb903de4fa9ddd341"> Material Symbols: using codepoints</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

Find both the icon names and codepoints on the [Material Symbols Library](https://fonts.google.com/icons/) by selecting any icon and opening the icon font panel. Each icon font has a codepoints index in the Google Fonts [git repository](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/variablefont) showing the complete set of names and character codes.
